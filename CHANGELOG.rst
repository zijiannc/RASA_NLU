This project adheres to `Semantic Versioning`_ starting with version 1.0.

[Unreleased 1.1.7] - `master`_
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added
-----
- added optional pymongo dependencies ``[tls, srv]`` to ``requirements.txt`` for better mongodb support


Changed
-------


Removed
-------


Fixed
-----
- validation no longer throws an error during interactive learning
- updated the server endpoint ``/model/parse`` to handle also messages with the intent prefix

[1.1.6] - 2019-07-12
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added
-----
- rest channel supports setting a message's input_channel through a field
  ``input_channel`` in the request body

Changed
-------
- recommended syntax for empty ``use_entities`` and ``ignore_entities`` in the domain file
  has been updated from ``False`` or ``None`` to an empty list (``[]``)

Fixed
-----
- ``rasa run`` without ``--enable-api`` does not require a local model anymore
- using ``rasa run`` with ``--enable-api`` to run a server now prints
  "running Rasa server" instead of "running Rasa Core server"
- actions, intents, and utterances created in ``rasa interactive`` can no longer be empty


[1.1.5] - 2019-07-10
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Added
-----
- debug logging now tells you which tracker store is connected
- the response of ``/model/train`` now includes a response header for the trained model filename
- ``Validator`` class to help developing by checking if the files have any errors
- project's code is now linted using flake8
- ``info`` log when credentials were provided for multiple channels and channel in
  ``--connector`` argument was specified at the same time
- validate export paths in interactive learning

Changed
-------
- deprecate ``rasa.core.agent.handle_channels(...)`. Please use ``rasa.run(...)``
  or ``rasa.core.run.configure_app`` instead.
- ``Agent.load()`` also accepts ``tar.gz`` model file

Removed
-------
- revert the stripping of trailing slashes in endpoint URLs since this can lead to
  problems in case the trailing slash is actually wanted

Fixed
-----

- fixed PUT /model with model_server by deserializing the model_server to 
  EndpointConfig.
- ``x in AnySlotDict`` is now ``True`` for any ``x``, which fixes empty slot warnings in
  interactive learning

  the command line interface
- ``MappingPolicy`` now works correctly when used as part of a PolicyEnsemble

  is now raised with instructions for linking one

Changed
-------
- renamed all CLI parameters containing any ``_`` to use dashes ``-`` instead (GNU standard)
- renamed ``rasa_core`` package to ``rasa.core``
- for interactive learning only include manually annotated and ner_crf entities in nlu export
- made ``message_id`` an additional argument to ``interpreter.parse``
- changed removing punctuation logic in ``WhitespaceTokenizer``
- ``training_processes`` in the Rasa NLU data router have been renamed to ``worker_processes``
- created a common utils package ``rasa.utils`` for nlu and core, common methods like ``read_yaml`` moved there
- removed ``--num_threads`` from run command (server will be asynchronous but
  running in a single thread)
- the ``_check_token()`` method in ``RasaChat`` now authenticates against ``/auth/verify`` instead of ``/user``
- removed ``--pre_load`` from run command (Rasa NLU server will just have a maximum of one model and that model will be
  loaded by default)
- changed file format of a stored trained model from the Rasa NLU server to ``tar.gz``
- train command uses fallback config if an invalid config is given
- test command now compares multiple models if a list of model files is provided for the argument ``--model``
- Merged rasa.core and rasa.nlu server into a single server. See swagger file in ``docs/_static/spec/server.yaml`` for
  available endpoints.
- ``utter_custom_message()`` method in rasa_core_sdk has been renamed to ``utter_elements()``
- updated dependencies. as part of this, models for spacy need to be reinstalled
  for 2.1 (from 2.0)
- make sure all command line arguments for ``rasa test`` and ``rasa interactive`` are actually used, removed arguments
  that were not used at all (e.g. ``--core`` for ``rasa test``)

Removed
-------
- removed possibility to execute ``python -m rasa_core.train`` etc. (e.g. scripts in ``rasa.core`` and ``rasa.nlu``).
  Use the CLI for rasa instead, e.g. ``rasa train core``.
- removed ``_sklearn_numpy_warning_fix`` from the ``SklearnIntentClassifier``
- removed ``Dispatcher`` class from core
- removed projects: the Rasa NLU server now has a maximum of one model at a time loaded.

Fixed
-----
- evaluating core stories with two stage fallback gave an error, trying to handle None for a policy
- the ``/evaluate`` route for the Rasa NLU server now runs evaluation
  in a parallel process, which prevents the currently loaded model unloading
- added missing implementation of the ``keys()`` function for the Redis Tracker
  Store
- in interactive learning: only updates entity values if user changes annotation
- log options from the command line interface are applied (they overwrite the environment variable)
- all message arguments (kwargs in dispatcher.utter methods, as well as template args) are now sent through to output channels
- utterance templates defined in actions are checked for existence upon training a new agent, and a warning
  is thrown before training if one is missing
